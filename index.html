    <!-- CSS lets you add common styles throughout the html page. HTML and CSS create static HTML pages -->
    <!-- Without Javascript a page is just static. Javascript adds dynamic and interactive and changing content. An example
    can be a date and time stamp. This changes everytime the page is loaded.-->
    <!-- Some notes about Git.hub
    I also this into Git under directory Code: Make sure when you create a new repository you don't have Readme checked.
    git remote add origin https://github.com/kbala97/Code.git
    git push -u origin master
    github is the remote repository. git is the local SCM (source control manager)
    To post a change to your local git repository click on the synch icon. It shows the mods. 
    To push code to github click on the synch arrows on the footer bar below.
